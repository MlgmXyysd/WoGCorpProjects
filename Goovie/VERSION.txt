-- If true, the actor is allowed to loop for the duration of the movie.

*Added: visible attribute to <actor> 
-- Note: Invisible actors are omitted from the encoded output, however..
-- they still "exist" so may affect the movie length is they have high keyframe times.

-- Can be interpolated to a different color in the next frame
