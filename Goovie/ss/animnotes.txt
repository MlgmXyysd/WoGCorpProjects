MOVIE
Actor First Frame Cannot be EMPTY... 
or ALPHA CANNOT BE EMPTY or.... 
the encoders doing something odd or....



Alpha only works when Color is also included and Intepolation is set to linear
Although Color can be 255,255,255 to have no effect.

If Alpha is set but not 255.....
' Warning if Color is empty or interpolation not linear or both

If color is set to "anything"..
' Warning if alpha is not set..


Color without Alpha... crashes Game... 
but color with Alpha can be no interpolation.. then colour is fixed and Alpha is always 255.


SceneLayer Scale is averaged (sx,sy) ==> (avg(sx,sy),avg(sx,sy))
Then multiplied by Animation Scale

If Animation doesn't have a scale... then SceneLayerScale is still averaged...
Represent in WooGLE??


Angles
Takes "shortest" path from Start Angle to End Angle

0 to 359  <=>  0 to -1
0 to 181  <=>  0 to -179
0 to 360  <=>  0 to 0  (does nothing)

0 to 180 to 360 = full 360 anti-clockwise
360 to 180 to 0 = full 360 clockwise

0 to 720  =  full 360 anti-clockwise
0 to 1080 =  720 anti-clockwise
